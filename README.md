# cs_MeshLab
A modo kit by @csprance to use MeshLab inside of modo.

## Installation
This is a modo kit so install it like normal. I've only tested this on Modo 11, but I don't think it's doing anything
fancy. Let me know if you run into any issues and if it works on other versions of modo!
* Extract/Clone into `%appdata%/Luxology/Kits`
* Restart modo

## How to use
* Select the mesh or meshes you'd like to create a polygon for
* `Click` the MeshLab button to open the form and select the settings
* `Click` the Calculate button after adjusting settings to have mesh calculated and added to the scene
